		<h2>Product Development Services</h2>
			<p>You spot an emerging trend in your customers' payment solutions needs. You want to build a product and get it into the hands of your customers as quickly as possible.
		
			<p>We can work with you and build the product for you. In fact, we can work with you and build you a robust and compelling product portfolio that spans across your customer's payment processing needs.</p>
			
			<p>You specify your hardware and software platform preference. We will design, develop and deliver the tested product to you. We will assist you during processor certifications and with post-deployment customer support.</p>
			
		<br>

		<h2>Payment Device Integration Services</h2>
			<p>Payment Device Integration requires interfacing with low-level device API. It can prove to be a repetitive, tedious and time consuming effort.</p>
			<p>We can take care of the complexity and provide you with a clean and easy to use API for your desired platform.
		</p>

		<br>
		 
		<h2>Payment Message API Development Services</h2>
			<p>You want to add a new payment processor to your existing product. We can provide you with an API to build the authorization request messages.</p>
			<p>Include our API in your product to sharply reduce your development time and effort. The API will be designed to meet PCI-DSS requirements.</p>
		<br>		
		
		<h2>Solution Testing Services</h2>
		<p>Your payment processing solutions are mission critical and any downtime can bring your customer's business to a grinding halt. Your solutions must work perfectly all the time, every time.</p>
		<p>Our Solution Testing Services offer the same rigor and attention to detail that we give to the products we design and develop. We can test your payment solutions and make sure your product is subjected to tests that cover every conceivable real-world scenario.</p>
		<p>We approach testing from the Payments domain perspective, and will help you make sure your products are compliant with Industry standards such as PCI-DSS. We can test a stand-alone API or the entire product suite.</p>
